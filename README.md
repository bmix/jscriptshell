From the original front-text:

## A JScript interactive shell for the Windows Script Host
JScriptShell provides a simple way to run scripts in an interactive environment for testing, debugging or exploratory programming.
JScriptShell is a copycat of the JavaScript shells from Mozilla (JavaScript Shell of SpiderMonkey and Rhino Shell) for Microsoft JScript and Windows Script Host. And all those shells are the JavaScript equivalent of Python's interactive prompt, the Lisp read-eval-print loop, or Ruby's irb.
JScriptShell is written in JScript itself and run on Windows Script Host which is distributed and installed by default on Windows 98 and later versions of Windows.
You can use JScriptShell under the terms of the Artistic License 2.0 or GNU General Public License (GPL).
